        <h3>What is Brew UI?</h3>
        <p className="subtitle faded">
          Brew UI is a plug-and-play collection of comprehensible, optimized, and customizable components.
        </p>
        <p className="subtitle faded">
          The components are completely open-source; you are free to modify and use them for personal and commercial
          projects.
        </p>
        <h3>What does plug-and-play mean?</h3>
        <p className="subtitle faded">
          It means you don't need to install Brew UI as a dependency; just copy and paste the source code into your
          project. All the necessary styling and functionality is already included.
        </p>
        <p className="subtitle faded">
          Brew UI components are meant to be used as they come out of the box or as a reference for you to customize
          them and create your own library.
        </p>
        <h3>Do the components have any dependencies?</h3>
        <p className="subtitle faded">
          Brew UI components have the following dependencies: <i>"react-tilt"</i>, <i>"styled-components"</i>.
